layout: default
status: draft
topics: 
    - new notes
---

**How to use:**

For each topic, create a page (e.g., _pages/topics/topic-name.md) with frontmatter:

```
---
layout: topic
topic: topic-name
permalink: /topics/topic-name/
---
```

The topic name in the frontmatter should match exactly (case-sensitive) whatâ€™s in your notes.
