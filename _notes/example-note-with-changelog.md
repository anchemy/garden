This is an example note that demonstrates the changelog feature.

You can add a `changelog_url` field to your note's front matter to link to its changelog. The changelog URL should point to the published changelog page.

For example, if your changelog is at `_changelogs/example-note-with-changelog.md` with the Jekyll permalink `/changelogs/example-note-with-changelog/`, you would add:

```yaml
changelog_url: /changelogs/example-note-with-changelog/
```

The changelog link will appear after the date information in the note's header.
